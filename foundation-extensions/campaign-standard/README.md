# Adobe Experience Platform Campaign extension

The Adobe Experience Platform Campaign extension provides a mobile interface to the [Adobe Campaign Standard platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard.html?lang=en). 

This extension allows your mobile app to subscribe user devices to your Campaign instance. Once subscribed, standard or profile based in-app messages can be created then delivered to the user's device to be displayed by the AEP SDK.

{% hint style="info" %}
This extension (AEPCampaign) is compatible with the Adobe Experience Platform Swift SDK, version 3.x and newer. Steps to migrate your app from a previous Objective-C implementation are available at the [migrate to Swift tutorial](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/migrate-to-swift).

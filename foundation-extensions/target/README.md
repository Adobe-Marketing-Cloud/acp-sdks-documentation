# Adobe Experience Platform Target Extension

The Adobe Experience Platform Target extension helps test, personalize, and optimize mobile app experiences based on user behavior and mobile context. You can deliver interactions that engage and convert through iterative testing and rules-based AI-powered personalization.

{% hint style="info" %}
This extension (AEPTarget) is compatible with Adobe Experience Platform's Swift SDK, version 3.x and newer. Steps to migrate your app from a previous Objective-C implementation are available at the [migrate to Swift tutorial](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/migrate-to-swift).

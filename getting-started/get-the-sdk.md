# Get the SDK

The Adobe Experience Platform SDK is available via Cocoapods and Gradle. 

1. Open the **Mobile** property in Launch and go to the **Environments** tab to view instructions for adding the SDKs to an app.
2. Find the platform needed in the table and click on the box icon under the **Install** column.
3. On the **Mobile Install Instructions** pop-up, choose **Android** or **iOS**.
4. Follow the instructions for using Gradle with Android or CocoaPods with iOS.

The necessary dependencies and initialization code can be copied from the pop-up to the app project.

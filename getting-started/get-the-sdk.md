# Get the Experience Platform SDK

The Experience Platform SDK is available for iOS via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), Android via [Gradle](https://gradle.org), and for React Native projects via [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org). Follow the directions below to learn how to incorporate the Experience Platform SDK into your application.

{% hint style="info" %}
For iOS and Android projects, the recommended approach to integrating the SDK is to use Cocoapods or Gradle. SDK libraries are also available on [Github](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/).

### Android

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Experience Platform SDK for Android supports Android 4.0 \(API 14\) or later.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Mobile** property in Experience Platform Launch, and click on the **Environments** tab, and then click on the install package icon![](../.gitbook/assets/package.png). 
2. On the **Mobile Install Instructions** dialog box, select **Android**.
3. Follow the instructions for using Gradle with Android.

The necessary dependencies and initialization code can be copied from the dialog box to your app project.

You should see a dialog box similar to the following:

2. On the **Mobile Install Instructions** dialog box, select **iOS**.
3. Follow the instructions for using CocoaPods with iOS.
4. Under the initialization code, choose Objective C.

The necessary dependencies and initialization code can be copied from the dialog box to your app project.

{% tab title="React Native" %}
### React Native

{% hint style="info" %}
For React Native, it is recommended to first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to download packages from [npm](https://npmjs.com).

See this [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) for additional instructions on getting started with React Native applications
{% endhint %}

`@adobe/react-native-acpcore` is a wrapper around the iOS and Android Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK to allow for integration with React Native applications. Functionality to enable the Core extension is provided entirely through JavaScript documented below.

First create the React Native project \(if one does not already exist\)

```jsx
react-native init MyReactApp
```

Install and link the `@adobe/react-native-acpcore` package:

```jsx
npm install @adobe/react-native-acpcore
react-native link @adobe/react-native-acpcore
```

#### Configure native projects

**Android project**

Navigate to `MainApplication.java` under `app/src/main/java/com/<project-name>/` and add a call to `MobileCore.setApplication(this)` inside of `onCreate()`.

```jsx
import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.MobileCore; // import MobileCore

@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    //...
    MobileCore.setApplication(this); // add this line
}
```

**iOS project**

Inside your Xcode project, click on the project file and under the **General** tab, click the **+** button under the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section, add the following frameworks and libraries:

* `UIKit.framework`
* `SystemConfiguration.framework`
* `WebKit.framework`
* `UserNotifications.framework`
* `libsqlite3.0.tbd`
* `libc++.tbd`
* `libz.tbd`

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you plan to use the AEP SDK in your native iOS code you will need to import the appropriate headers with the following format: `#import <RCTACPCore/ACPCore.h>`

# Next steps

Now that you've initialized the SDK and the **Mobile Core**, you can now start implementing **Extensions** that will help you use Adobe Experience Cloud or third-party vendor functionality in your apps.

Choose an extension to get started:

1. Set up [Adobe Analytics](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics/)
2. Set up [Adobe Audience Manager](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-audience-manager/)
3. Set up [Adobe Target](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-target/)

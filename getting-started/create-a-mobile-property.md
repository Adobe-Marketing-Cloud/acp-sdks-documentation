3. Type your Experience Cloud Org ID.

   By default, this value is auto-populated using the currently signed-in Organization ID. This is a required identifier for your Experience Cloud Organization and is typically a 24-character, alphanumeric string followed by _@AdobeOrg_. If you need help finding it, contact your Adobe CSM or Customer Care.

4. \(Optional\) Provide your Experience Cloud ID Server.

   This is an optional server value that is used to send Visitor ID Service network requests to a custom endpoint. If this property is not set, the visitor identifiers sync requests are sent to _dpm.demdex.net_ when the `Identity` extension is registered.

5. Optionally, change the **Session Timeout** value.

   A default value of 300 seconds is already set. This timeout value indicates the number of seconds that must pass after a user backgrounds the app before a launch is considered to be a new Lifecycle session.

   a. Click **Save** to confirm your settings for **Mobile Core**.

   b. Click **Catalog** and install the extensions that you need.

   click **Add New Library**.

2. Specify a name for the library and, from the **Environment** drop-down list, select a development environment .
3. Add the configuration changes to be deployed.

5. Click **Save & Build for Development**.   **Tip**: The library builds and is displayed under the **Development** section of the publishing workflow.
6. Click on the down arrow for the library and select **Submit for Approval**.

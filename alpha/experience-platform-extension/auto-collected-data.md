# Automatically collected information

The Experience Platform Mobile extension automatically collects and adds information to each Platform event that is sent to the Adobe Experience Platform. The following sections provide details about the collected information:

## Platform event

The [Experience Event](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/docs/reference/context/experienceevent.schema.md) is a time-based record of an event. The XDM Experience Event schema is the top-level class for all Experience events and contains information about the event, device, environment, and the identity of the user. Here are the properties the Experience Platform Mobile extension automatically adds to each Platform event:

| Property  | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Timestamp | The time when the event occurred. The timestamp is set when the Platform event is received by the Experience Platform Mobile extension. |
| ID        | A unique identifier for the time-series event.               |

## Identity

The [IdentityMap](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/1c22180490558e3c13352fe3e0540cb7e93c69ca/docs/reference/context/identitymap.schema.md) defines a map that contains end-user identities. Here are the identity properties the Experience Platform Mobile extension automatically adds to each Platform event:

| Property | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ECID     | The Experience Cloud Identifier (ECID)  that is generated by the Adobe Experiece Cloud Mobile SDK is added to the Platform event's `IdentityMap` . If the event contains an `IdentityMap` object, the ECID is added to the `IdentityMap` If the event does not contain the object, a new object is created and is added to the Platform event. |

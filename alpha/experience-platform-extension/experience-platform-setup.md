# Experience Platform setup

## Prepare Platform

To send data to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com/), you need to create an XDM schema and a dataset that uses the schema.

- [Create a schema](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/tutorials/alltutorials.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/schema_editor_tutorial/schema_editor_tutorial.md)
- Assign the XDM ExperienceEvent class to your schema.
- Add the following mixins: 
  - ExperienceEvent Application Details
  - ExperienceEvent Environment Details
  - ExperienceEvent Commerce Details
- [Create a dataset](https://platform.adobe.com/dataset/overview) where your data should be sent by using the schema that you created earlier.

## Requesting a configuration ID

To use the Mobile SDK, you need a configuration ID, which ensures that your data is routed to the correct location. To obtain a configuration ID from your consultant or through Adobe Client Care, provide the following information:

- Org ID: To locate this ID, complete the instructions in [Organizations and account linking](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/organizations.html).
- Dataset ID, which is available in the dataset UI when you click on a dataset.
- Schema ID, which is available at the end of the URL of the schema creation/viewing page.
- Friendly Name, which is the name that will be used in future UIs for this configuration.

After you received your configuration ID, you can continue with the [Set up the SDK](./set-up-the-sdk) steps.

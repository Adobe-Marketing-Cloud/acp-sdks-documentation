# Adobe Experience Platform for Mobile

## Data Collection via Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK is required to power Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps. The SDK is composed of the Mobile Core and a series of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor extensions that depend on the Mobile Core. Each extension registers with the Mobile Core to provide features specific to the solution or service it represents.

Data collection for Adobe Experience Platform is done through the Edge Network and the new [Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network]() extension. This extension, like other SDK extensions, is a client-side, native library that allows customers of Adobe Experience Cloud to interact with various Experience Cloud services throughout the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network.

## Supported Platforms

Data collection via Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network provides support for the following platforms:

* Android \(see [Current SDK Versions](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/upgrading-to-aep/current-sdk-versions) for download links\)
* iOS \(includes iOS, iPadOS\) \(see [Current SDK Versions](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/upgrading-to-aep/current-sdk-versions) for download links\)

# Overview

## Overview

The **Adobe Experience Platform SDK** is required to power Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps. The SDK is composed of the **Mobile Core** and a series of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor **Extensions** that depend on the **Mobile Core**. Each **Extension** registers with the **Mobile Core** to provide features specific to the solution or service it represents.

To start implementing the SDK, you'll need to first create a mobile property in Adobe Experience Platform Launch. You'll setup configuration required by the **Mobile Core** and any **Extensions** you add, and then publish the configuration into an **Environment**. When you implement the SDK in your app, you'll reference the Environment to get going.

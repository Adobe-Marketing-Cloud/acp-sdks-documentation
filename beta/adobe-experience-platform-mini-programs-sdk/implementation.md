# Implementation

The following instructions will help you implement the Adobe Experience Platform SDK in your WeChat Mini Programs.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Getting the SDK**

Download links for the SDK will be provided as part of the beta welcome email, after the beta kick-off call. Please contact your Adobe account representative or CSM if you have not received this information.
{% endhint %}

## Add the SDK to your project

In your Mini Program's `app.js`file, reference and require the SDK, for example:

```javascript
const AdobeSDK = require('AdobeSDK.js');
```

## Initialize the SDK

In the `onLaunch` method of your `app.js` file, implement `AdobeSDK.init()` and pass in valid configuration values using the **.init\(configuration\)** method, for example:

{% hint style="warning" %}
To find the settings for your Adobe Analytics implementation, contact your Adobe Analytics administrator or Adobe consulting for assistance.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
// App({
//   onLaunch: function () {
//     // 展示本地存储能力
//     var logs = wx.getStorageSync('logs') || []
//     logs.unshift(Date.now())
//     wx.setStorageSync('logs', logs)
     AdobeSDK.init({
       "analytics.server": "example.sc.adobedc.cn",      //required
       "analytics.rsids": "example.reportsuite",    //required
       "app.id": "adobe-demo",                        //required
       "app.version": "0.0.0.1",           //optional, default value = ''
       "analytics.offlineEnabled": true,   //optional, default value = false
       "session.timeout": 30               //optional, default value = 30
     });
// })
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If the key`analytics.offlineEnabled` is set to true, then timestamp\(ts\) is included in Analytics request.

The key`lifecycle.sessionTimeout`Time, in seconds, that must elapse between the time the app is launched and before the launch is considered to be a new session. This timeout also applies when your application is sent to the background and reactivated. Default value is 30 seconds.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Upon initialization, the SDK will automatically collect and transmit lifecycle metrics to Adobe Analytics. For a full list of metrics, see [Lifeycle metrics](implementation.md#lifecycle-metrics).
{% endhint %}

## Enable debug logging

### AdobeSDK.setDebugLoggingEnabled\(flag\)

```javascript
AdobeSDK.setDebugLoggingEnabled(true)
```

### AdobeSDK.setDebugModeEnabled\(flag\)

By default, the SDK hides internal exceptions and print error message in console log. To let the SDK throw those exceptions, you need to enable debug mode.

```javascript
AdobeSDK.setDebugModeEnabled(true)
```

## Track screens and user actions

You may use the following screen and action tracking APIs to measure your user's engagement with your app.

### AdobeSDK.trackAction\(actionName, contextData\)

Actions are events that occur in your app. Use this API to track and measure an action, where each action has one or more corresponding metrics that increment each time the event occurs. For example, you might call this API for each new subscription each time an article is viewed, or each time a level is completed.

{% hint style="info" %}
`trackAction`reports the Action as an **event** and does not increment your page views in Analytics. The value is sent to Analytics by using the action variable \(`action=value`\).
{% endhint %}

```javascript
AdobeSDK.trackAction("action", { "example.key": "value" });
```

### AdobeSDK.trackState\(stateName, contextData\)

{% hint style="info" %}
`trackState` reports the View State as **Page Name**, and state views are reported as **Page View** in Analytics. The value is sent to Analytics by using the page name variable \(`pagename=value`\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This API may be implemented in the `onShow` method of the `Page`to track when users switch to screens or pages.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
AdobeSDK.trackState("state", { "example.key": "value" });
```

## Lifecycle metrics

Upon SDK initialization, lifecycle metrics will be automatically sent to Adobe Analytics. The following is a complete list of metrics that will be collected and sent:

### Install  <a id="install"></a>

| **Metric** | **Key** | **DescriptIon** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First Launches | `a.InstallEvent` | Triggered at first run after installation or re-installation. |
| Install Date | `a.InstallDate` | Date of first launch after installation. The format is `M/d/yyyy`, and an example is `5/3/2017`. |

### Upgrade

| **Metric** | **Key** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Upgrades | `a.UpgradeEvent` | Triggered at the first run after upgrade or when the version number changes. |
| Days since last upgrade | `a.DaysSinceLastUpgrade` | Number of days since the application version number  changed. |
| Launches since last upgrade | `a.LaunchesSinceUpgrade` | Number of launches since the application version number changed. |

### Launch

| **Metric** | **Key** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Daily Engaged Users | `a.DailyEngUserEvent` | Triggered when the application is used on a particular day. **Important**: This metric is not automatically stored in Analytics. You must create a processing rule that sets a custom event to capture this metric. |
| Monthly Engaged Users | `a.MonthlyEngUserEvent` | Triggered when the application is used during a particular month. **Important**: This metric is not automatically stored in Analytics. You must create a processing rule that sets a custom event to capture this metric. |
| Launches | `a.LaunchEvent` | Triggered on every run, including crashes and installs. Also triggered when the app is resumed from the background after the lifecycle session timeout is exceeded. |
| Previous Session Length | `a.PrevSessionLength` | Reports the number of seconds that a previous application session lasted based on how long the application was open and in the foreground. |
| Launch Number | `a.Launches` | Number of times the application was launched or brought out of the background. |
| Days since first use | `a.DaysSinceFirstUse` | Number of days since first run. |
| Days since last use | `a.DaysSinceLastUse` | Number of days since last use. |
| Hour of Day | `a.HourOfDay` | Measures the hour the app was launched and uses the 24-hour numerical format. Used for time parting to determine peak usage times. |
| Day of Week | `a.DayOfWeek` | Measures the day of the week the app was launched. |

### Device information

| Metric | Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AppID | `a.AppID` | Stores the application name and version in the `AppName BundleVersion (app version code)` format. An example of this format is `MyAppName 1.1(1)`. This value will be populated from the app id provided in SDK configuration. |
| .Device name | `a.DeviceName` | Stores the device name. |
| Operating system version | `a.OSVersion` | Operating system name and version. |
| Resolution | `a.Resolution` | Width x height, in pixels. |
| Run mode | `a.RunMode` | The SDK running mode, for example, `Application/Extension`. |

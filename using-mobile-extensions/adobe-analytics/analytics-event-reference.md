# Analytics event reference

## Internal Events for Adobe Analytics

In addition to the Analytics hits that are sent as a result of the track call, the Adobe Experience Cloud Platform SDKs also tracks some internal events that are based on the communication with other modules.

Here is a list of the events by module:

### Lifecycle Module

Here are the Analytics events in the Lifecycle module:

#### Install Event

The SDK tracks the application install details when lifecycle is enabled. These details include the install date and the daily engaged/monthly engaged user badges.

#### Launch Event

The SDK tracks every new launch of the application when lifecycle is enabled.

A launch is considered to be new when the following conditions are met:

* The application is reopened from the background after the configured session timeout.
* The application is opened after a force close.

Launch data includes information about the application's number of launches, days since first run, days since last use, user daily/monthly engaged badges along with other lifecycle metrics.

We also track the application version upgrades.

#### Crash Event

If your application is terminated without having first been backgrounded, the SDK reports a crash the next time your app is launched.

This will be sent as an individual hit if the `backdateSessionInfo` flag is enabled in your configuration, otherwise it will be sent as part of the launch event.

#### SessionInfo

This hit contains information about the previous launch session, more specifically the session length.

This will be sent as an individual hit if backdateSessionInfo flag is enabled in your configuration, otherwise it will be sent as part of the launch event.

### Identity Module

Here are the Analytics events that are triggered when the Identity module is enabled:

* Push

The SDK tracks changes in the user's push notifications preference. A new hit is sent whenever the user opt-in/opt-out for push notifications.

### Messages Module

Here are the Analytics events that are triggered when the Messages module is enabled:

* In-App Message

The SDK tracks the following metrics for your in-app messages:

For Full Screen and Alert style in-app messages:

* Impressions: when user triggers an in-app message.
* Click throughs: when user pushes the Click-through button.
* Cancels: when user pushes the Cancel button.

For local \(remote\) notifications:

* Impressions: when user triggers the notification.
* Opens: when user opens app from the notification. This will be tracked with the trackAdobeDeepLink method.

### Target Module

Here is the Analytics event in the Target module:

* AnalyticsForTarget

  The SDK forwards Target's data to analytics when A4T is enabled in Target Services.

## Events Handled by Adobe Analytics

### Analytics Content Request  <a id="analytics-content-request"></a>

This event is a request to do processing on the analytics hits queue and can be used in one of the following situations:

* Send a new Analytics hit to the server.
* Send all the Analytics hits, regardless of the batching settings.
* Clear all the Analytics hits that are queued, but are not yet sent.
* Get current number of Analytics hits in the queue.

The Analytics extension receives this event with the following keys, and the extension processes the keys accordingly:

* `action`/`state` - gets the Analytics request data and processes the hit.
* `clearhitsqueue` - clears the Analytics hit database.
* `forcekick` - sends all the hits in database.
* `getqueuesize` - retrieves the current number of queued hits in the database; this is a paired event associated with a response callback.

**Tip**: The keys are optional, but there should be at least one key specified at a time \(action/state/contextdata\) for the hit to be processed.

This event is generated by:

* Calling the Analytics request `track` public API.
* The SDK when tracking internal actions. For more information, see [Internal Events for Adobe Analytics](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/build-your-own-extension/events/adobe-analytics/internal-events-for-adobe-analytics).
* Calling the analyticsSendQueuedHits API
* Calling the analyticsClearQueue public API
* Calling the analyticsGetQueueSize public API

```

### Acquisition Referrer Information Response  <a id="acquistion-referrer-information-response"></a>

This event will be the response from the Acquisition extension for the referrer information request event, and this event will be generated by the Acquisition extension when the request event for referrer information is received by the extension and the information is retrieved by the extension.

Analytics listens to the referrer information and create a analytics hit along with data from the install lifecycle event.

#### Event Details  <a id="event-details-2"></a>

| **Event Type** | **Event Source** | **Paired** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.acquisition | com.adobe.eventSource.responseContent | No |

Here are the key/value pairs that will be present in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| contextdata | Map | No | The data value will contain the KV pairs that define the referrer information collected by the Acquisition extension. |

The key-value pairs that are standard and defined in the SDK are:

* campaign
* source
* medium
* term
* content
* trackingCode
* contextData
* adobeData

The data might contain other custom key-value pairs not defined as standard. Also, all the KV pairs are optional.

#### Sample Event Payload  <a id="sample-event-payload"></a>

```text
{    "contextdata": {        "campaign": "testCampaign",        "source": "adv",        "contextData":{                "contextDatakey":"contextDataValue"        },        "adobeData":{                "adobeDataKey":"adobeDataValue"        },        "mycustomkey":"mycustomValue"    }}
```

### Lifecycle Request Content

This event represents a request to the Lifecycle module to start/stop collecting data.

This event will be generated when `collectLifecycleData()` and `pauseCollectingLifecycleData()` are used.

The Analytics module listens only to the Lifecycle Start Event, and the Analytics database queue should then be held for up to `DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE_RESPONSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT` \(ms\) to wait for the corresponding response content event.

#### Event Details  <a id="event-details-3"></a>

| **Event Type** | **Event Source** | **Paired** |

```text
{    "type":"start",    "contextData":{        "contextDataKey":"contextDataValue"    }}
```

### Lifecycle Response Content

This event is a response from the Lifecycle module to notify lifecycle context data in which a client/module might be interested.

This event will be generated by the Lifecycle module, and the public API is called after a lifecycle start, stop, or pause.

The Analytics module waits for the lifecycle data and appends it to a exiting hit. Otherwise, a new hit is sent for lifecycle data, and the lifecycle timer is cancelled to mark that the lifecycle data has been received and processed.

If the backdate session option is enabled, use the timestamp of the last session as the timestamp of the current analytics request, and insert the data to the Analytics queue before any other request is received in the current session.

```

#### Install Event  <a id="install-event"></a>

The SDK tracks the application install details when lifecycle is enabled. These details include the install date and the daily engaged/monthly engaged user badges.

```text
{    "lifecyclecontextdata": {        "installevent" : "InstallEvent",        "dailyenguserevent" : "DailyEngUserEvent",        "monthlyenguserevent":"MonthlyEngUserEvent",        "installdate":"22/05/2014"        ...    },}
```

#### Launch Event  <a id="launch-event"></a>

When lifecycle is enabled, the SDK tracks every new launch of the application.

A launch is considered to be new when the following conditions are met:

* The application is reopened from the background after the configured session timeout.
* The application is opened after a force close.

Launch data includes information about the application's number of launches, days since first run, days since last use, user daily/monthly engaged badges, and other lifecycle metrics.

We also track the application version upgrades.

```text
{    "lifecyclecontextdata": {        "launchevent" : "LaunchEvent",        "dailyenguserevent" : "DailyEngUserEvent",        "monthlyenguserevent":"MonthlyEngUserEvent",        "installdate":"22/05/2014",        "launches":42,        "dayssincelastuse" : 4,        "dayssincefirstuse" : 28        ...    },}
```

#### Crash Event  <a id="crash-event"></a>

If your application is terminated without having first been backgrounded, the SDK reports a crash the next time your app is launched.

If the `backdateSessionInfo` flag is enabled in your configuration, this information is sent as an individual hit. Otherwise it is sent as part of the launch event.

```text
{    "lifecyclecontextdata": {        "crashevent" : "CrashEvent",        "launchevent" : "LaunchEvent",        "dailyenguserevent" : "DailyEngUserEvent",        "monthlyenguserevent":"MonthlyEngUserEvent",        "installdate":"22/05/2014",        "launches":42,        "dayssincelastuse" : 4,        "dayssincefirstuse" : 28        ...    },}
```

#### SessionInfo  <a id="sessioninfo"></a>

This hit contains information, such as the session lenght, about the previous launch session.

If the `backdateSessionInfo` flag is enabled in your configuration, this information is sent as an individual hit. Otherwise it will be sent as part of the launch event.

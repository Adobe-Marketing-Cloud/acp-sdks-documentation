# Analytics event reference

## Internal events for Adobe Analytics

In addition to the Analytics hits that are sent as a result of the track call, the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs also track some internal events that are based on the communication with other extensions.

Here is a list of the events by extension:

### Lifecycle extension

Here are the Analytics events in the Lifecycle extension:

#### Install event

The SDK tracks the application install details when lifecycle is enabled. These details include the install date and the daily engaged/monthly engaged user badges.

#### Launch event

The SDK tracks every new launch of the application when lifecycle is enabled.

A launch is considered to be new when the following conditions are met:

* The application is reopened from the background after the configured session timeout.
* The application is opened after a force close.

Launch data includes information about the application's number of launches, days since first run, days since last use, user daily/monthly engaged badges, and other lifecycle metrics.

We also track the application version upgrades.

#### Crash event

If your application is terminated without having first been backgrounded, the SDK reports a crash the next time your app is launched. If the `backdateSessionInfo` flag is enabled in your configuration, this crash is sent as an individual hit. If the flag is not enabled, the crash is sent as part of the launch event.

#### SessionInfo

This hit contains information about the previous launch session, such as the session length.

This information is sent as an individual hit if the `backdateSessionInfo` flag is enabled in your configuration. If the flag is not enabled, the information is sent as part of the launch event.

### Identity extension

The following Analytics event is triggered when the Identity extension is enabled:

#### Push

The SDK tracks changes in the user's push notifications preference, and a new hit is sent after the user opts in or out for push notifications.

### Messages extension

The following Analytics event is triggered when the Messages extension is enabled:

#### In-App message

The SDK tracks the following metrics for your in-app messages:

* For Full Screen and Alert style in-app messages:
  * **Impressions**: when user triggers an in-app message.
  * **Click throughs**: when user presses the **Click-through** button.
  * **Cancels**: when user presses the **Cancel** button.
* For local \(remote\) notifications:
  * **Impressions**: when user triggers the notification.
  * **Opens**: when user opens app from the notification.  This will be tracked with the `trackAdobeDeepLink` method.

### Target extension

The Analytics event in the Target extension is `AnalyticsForTarget`. The SDK forwards Target's data to Analytics when A4T is enabled in Target Services.

## Events handled by Analytics

### Analytics content request <a id="analytics-content-request"></a>

This event is a request to complete processing on the Analytics hits queue and can be used in one of the following situations:

* When a new Analytics hit is sent to the server.
* When all the Analytics hits are sent, regardless of the batching settings.
* When all the Analytics hits that are queued are cleared but are not yet sent.
* When you get the current number of Analytics hits in the queue.

The Analytics extension receives this event with the following keys, and the extension processes the keys:

* `action`/`state` - gets the Analytics request data and processes the hit.
* `clearhitsqueue` - clears the Analytics hit database.
* `forcekick` - sends all the hits in database.
* `getqueuesize` - retrieves the current number of queued hits in the database. This is a paired event that is associated with a response callback.

**Tip**: The keys are optional, but there should be at least one key specified at a time \(action/state/context data\) for the hit to be processed.

This event is generated by:

* Calling the Core `trackAction` or `trackState` API.
* The SDK when tracking internal actions.  For more information, see [Internal Events for Adobe Analytics](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics/analytics-event-reference#internal-events-for-adobe-analytics).
* Calling the Analytics `sendQueuedHits` , `clearQueue`, or `getQueueSize` APIS.

#### Event data examples <a id="event-data-example"></a>

**Track request**

Here is an example of event data for a Track request:

```text
{    "action": "clicked add button",    "state":"cart page",    "contextdata":{        "key1" : "value1",        "key2" : "value2"    },    "trackinternal": false}
```

#### Event data example <a id="event-data-example-0"></a>

**Send all Analytics hits request**

```text
{ "clearhitsqueue": true }
```

#### Event data example <a id="event-data-example-2"></a>

**Get queue size request**

```text
{ "getqueuesize": true }

### Analytics request identity <a id="analytics-request-identity"></a>

This event is responsible for fetching the Analytics tracking identifier \(AID\) and custom visitor identifier \(VID\) from the Analytics extension and is generated in the Analytics `getTrackingIdentifier` and `getCustomVisitorIdentifier` calls.

After the Analytics identity request event is received, the Analytics extension completes one of the following tasks:

* Checks the persistence for the saved AID and VID.
* If `nil`, creates a sync network request to the Analytic server to retrieve the AID. 
* Dispatches an Analytics Identity Response Event with the AID and VID value.

#### Data payload definition <a id="data-payload-definition-1"></a>

No key is required for the Analytics request event.

#### Event details <a id="event-details-1"></a>

### Configuration response content <a id="configuration-response-content"></a>

The data property in this event is used by each extension to modify its current settings. Each extension is responsible for reading the part of the data property in which it is concerned.

This event will be generated in the following scenarios:

* Initial config requested by the customer.
* Configuration modified \(remote update or local developer action\).
* In response to a configuration request event with the `config.getData` data key.

For more information about the data payload definition for this event, see the _Configuration Keys_ topics in each extension section.

```

### Acquisition referrer information response <a id="acquistion-referrer-information-response"></a>

This event is the response from the Acquisition extension for the referrer information request event. The event is generated by the Acquisition extension after the request event for the referrer information is received by the extension, and the information is retrieved by the extension. Analytics listens to the referrer information and creates a analytics hit with data from the install lifecycle event.

#### Event details <a id="event-details-2"></a>

| **Event Type** | **Event Source** | **Paired** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `com.adobe.eventType.acquisition` | com.adobe.eventSource.responseContent | No |

#### Data payload definition <a id="data-payload-definition-3"></a>

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `contextdata` | Map | No | The data value contains the key-value pairs that define the referrer information that is collected by the Acquisition extension. |

Here are the standard key-value pairs that are defined in the SDK:

* `campaign`
* `source`
* `medium`
* `term`
* `content`
* `trackingCode`
* `contextData`
* `adobeData`

The data might contain other custom key-value pairs that are not defined as standard.

{% hint style="info" %}
All of the key-value pairs are optional.
{% endhint %}

#### Sample event payload <a id="sample-event-payload"></a>

```text
{    "contextdata": {        "campaign": "testCampaign",        "source": "adv",        "contextData":{                "contextDatakey":"contextDataValue"        },        "adobeData":{                "adobeDataKey":"adobeDataValue"        },        "mycustomkey":"mycustomValue"    }}
```

### Lifecycle request content

This event represents a request to the Lifecycle extension to start or stop collecting data and is generated when `collectLifecycleData()` and `pauseCollectingLifecycleData()` are used.

The Analytics extension listens only to the Lifecycle Start Event, and the Analytics database queue should be paused for up to `DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE_RESPONSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT` \(ms\) to wait for the corresponding response content event.

#### Event details <a id="event-details-3"></a>

| **Event Type** | **Event Source** | **Paired** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle` | com.adobe.eventSource.requestContent | No |

#### Data payload definition <a id="data-payload-definition-4"></a>

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | String | No | Has one of these values: Start\|Stop\|Pause |
| `contextdata` | Map | YES | Map containing the user supplied context data. |

```text
{ "type":"start",    "contextData":{        "contextDataKey":"contextDataValue" }}
```

### Lifecycle response content

This event is a response from the Lifecycle extension to notify a client/extension about lifecycle context data in which the extension/client might be interested. The event is generated by the Lifecycle extension, and the API is called after a lifecycle start, stop, or pause.

The Analytics extension waits for the lifecycle data and appends it to an exiting hit. Otherwise, a new hit is sent for lifecycle data, and the lifecycle timer is cancelled to mark that the lifecycle data has been received and processed. If the backdate session option is enabled, use the timestamp of the last session as the timestamp of the current Analytics request and insert the data to the Analytics queue before another request is received in the current session.

#### Launch event <a id="launch-event"></a>

After lifecycle is enabled, the SDK tracks every new launch of the application.

A launch is considered to be new when the following conditions are met:

* The application is reopened from the background after the configured session timeout.
* The application is opened after a force close.

Launch data includes information about the application's number of launches, days since first run, days since last use, user daily/monthly engaged badges, and other lifecycle metrics. Application version upgrades is also tracked.

```text

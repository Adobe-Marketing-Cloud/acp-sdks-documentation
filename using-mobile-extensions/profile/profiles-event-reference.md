# Profiles event reference

## Events Handled

Here are the events that are handled by the Profile extension:

### USER\_PROFILE : REQUEST\_PROFILE

The event is used to put a user profile attribute update action on the Event Hub. This will be consumed by the [User Profile](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/ADMSMobile/V5+Module+-+User+Profile) module.

This event will be generated when an `updateUserAttribute` call is made by the SDK client.

#### Event Details

| **Event Type** | **Event Source** | **Paired** | **Paired Event** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.userProfile | com.adobe.eventSource.requestProfile | No |  |

#### Data Payload Definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| userprofileupdatekey | Map&lt;String, Object&gt; | no | A map of all the attributes and the attribute values that the client wants to update/add to the User Profile that is managed by the Adobe Cloud Platform SDK. An existing attribute name will update the attribute in the SDK, and a new attribute name will add a new attribute to the profile. When the value of an attribute is null, the attribute will be deleted from the profile. Currently supported object types are String, Integer, Double, Boolean, Map and Vector. All the other types will be ignored while processing. |

#### Event Data Example

Here is a code sample of the `USER_PROFILE : REQUEST_PROFILE` event:

```text
{
    EventName : "UserProfileUpdate"
    EventType : "com.adobe.eventType.userProfile",
    EventSource : "com.adobe.eventSource.requestProfile",
    EventData: {
            "userProfileupdatekey":
                     {
                        "userName": "JohnDoe",
                        "creditPoints": 255,
                        "isPaidUser": true
                     }
                }
}
```

### USERPROFILE : REQUEST\_RESET

This event clears the specified key from the User Profile extension and is generated when the `removeUserAttributes` public API is called.

#### Data Payload Definition

| Key/Key Type | Value Type | Optional | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| userprofileremovekey | String | No | The attribute key which has to be deleted |

#### Example

Here is a code sample of the `USERPROFILE : REQUEST_RESET` event:

```text
{
    EventName : "RemoveUserProfile"
    EventType : "com.adobe.eventType.userProfile",
    EventSource : "com.adobe.eventSource.requestReset",
    EventData: {
                "userprofileremovekey": "userName"
               }
}
```

## Events Dispatched

Here are the events that are dispatched by the Profile extension:

### USER\_PROFILE : RESPONSE\_PROFILE

The event is used to share the user profile with the other extension. This event will be generated by the User Profile extension when the user profile is updated and persistently stored.

#### Data Payload Definition

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| userprofiledata | Map&lt;String, Object&gt; | no | A map of all the user profile attributes and the attribute values. This map will contain all the user profile attributes \(the most updated copy\). The consumers of this data may replace the existing user profile copy that they may have with this copy. |

Here is a code sample for the `USER_PROFILE : RESPONSE_PROFILE` event:

```text
{
    EventName : "UserProfile Response Event"
    EventType : "com.adobe.eventType.userProfile",
    EventSource : "com.adobe.eventSource.responseProfile",
    EventData: {
          "userprofiledata":
               {
                "userName": "John Doe"
                 "creditPoints": 255,
                 "isPaidUser": true
               }
          }
}
```

## Shared State

**EXTENSION\_NAME**: `com.adobe.module.userProfile`

The Profile extension shared state is created in the following situations:

* **On Initialization:** After the extension is initialized, it will update the shared state by reading the previously set value from persistence.
* **On Every UserProfile Attribute Create/Update:** The Shared state is updated whenever there is a change in the user attribute data either from public API or by other triggers \(Rules Engine\).

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| userprofiledata | Map&lt;String, Object&gt; | no | Map containing all the key-value pairs of the user profile attributes. |

### Configure Campaign Standard Extension

![](../.gitbook/assets/campaign-extension-config.png)

#### ACS Endpoints

{% hint style="info" %}
Trying to find your ACS endpoint URLs? Contact your beta manager.
{% endhint %}

Provide endpoint URL\(s\) for your Adobe Campaign Standard instances. You may specify up to three unique endpoints for your development, staging, and production environments. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this beta extension, these endpoints URLs should be entered in **without** a prefixing  `http://` or `https://.`
{% endhint %}

#### pKey

A unique, auto-generated identifier for a mobile app configured in Adobe Campaign Standard. After you've configured this extension in Launch, you will need to configure your Launch mobile property in Adobe Campaign Standard. When the configuration in Campaign is successful, pKeys will be automatically generated, per Campaign Standard instance, and configured in Launch Campaign extension for successful validation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Need help connecting your Launch mobile property with your Campaign Standard mobile app? For more information, see [Configuring a mobile application using Adobe Experience Platform SDKs](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/configuring-app-sdk.html).
{% endhint %}

#### MCIAS Endpoint

{% hint style="info" %}
Trying to find your MCIAS endpoint URL? Contact your beta manager.
{% endhint %}

Provide your in-app messaging service URL endpoint. The SDK retrieves all in-app messaging rules and definition payloads from this endpoint.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this beta extension, the MCIAS endpoint URL should be provided **with** a prefixing`http://` or `https://` and **must** end with a forward slash. For example, `https://mcias-va7.cloud.adobe.io/mcias/`.
{% endhint %}

#### Request Timeout

Time in seconds to wait for a response from the in-app messaging service, before timing out. The SDK default timeout value is 5 seconds.

## Add Campaign Standard to your app

{% hint style="warning" %}
This beta extension is currently available only for iOS development.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
This **beta** Campaign Standard extension requires [Mobile Core](mobile-core/) and [Profile](profile/) **beta** extensions. If you are using other versions of Mobile Core and Profile libraries, use the beta version instead, as the instructions below indicate.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/acs-beta-pods.png)

Add the Campaign Standard, [Mobile Core](mobile-core/), and [Profile](profile/) beta libraries to your project. You'll need to add the following pods to your `Podfile`:

```text
pod 'ACPCoreBeta', '1.0.2beta'
pod 'ACPCampaignBeta', '1.0.2beta'
pod 'ACPUserProfileBeta', '1.0.1beta'
```

or you can manually include the [Mobile Core](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/releases/tag/v1.0.2beta-ACPCore), [Campaign Standard](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/releases/tag/v1.0.2beta-ACPCampaign), and [Profile](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/releases/tag/v1.0.1beta-ACPUserProfile) beta extensions found in Github.

In Xcode, import the Mobile Core beta, Campaign Standard beta, and Profile extensions:

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
#import <ACPCore_iOS/ACPCore_iOS.h>
#import <ACPCampaign_iOS/ACPCampaign_iOS.h>
#import <ACPIdentity_iOS/ACPIdentity_iOS.h>
#import <ACPSignal_iOS/ACPSignal_iOS.h>
#import <ACPLifecycle_iOS/ACPLifecycle_iOS.h>
#import <ACPUserProfile_iOS/ACPUserProfile.h>
```

#### Swift

```swift
import ACPCore_iOS
import ACPCampaign_iOS
import ACPIdentity_iOS
import ACPLifecycle_iOS
import ACPSignal_iOS
import ACPUserProfile_iOS
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Register Campaign Standard with Mobile Core

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}
In your app's`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, register the Campaign Standard extension:

#### Objective-C <a id="objective-c-1"></a>

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [ACPCampaign registerExtension];
    [ACPIdentity registerExtension];
    [ACPLifecycle registerExtension];
    [ACPSignal registerExtension];
    [ACPUserProfile registerExtension];
  // Override point for customization after application launch.
  return YES;
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
   ACPCampaign.registerExtension();
   ACPIdentity.registerExtension();
   ACPLifecycle.registerExtension();
   ACPSignal.registerExtension();   
   ACPUserProfile.registerExtension();
  // Override point for customization after application launch.
  return true;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Set up push messaging

After you follow [Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/HandlingRemoteNotifications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH6-SW1) to get your app ready to handle push notifications, you will need to set the push token using the [`setPushIdentifier`](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/identity/identity-api-reference#set-the-push-identifier) API:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}
### setPushIdentifier

#### Objective-C

#### Syntax

```objectivec
+ (void) setPushIdentifier: (nullable NSData*) deviceToken;
```

#### Example

```objectivec
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
  // Set the deviceToken that the APNS has assigned to the device
  [ACPCore setPushIdentifier:deviceToken];
  //...
}
```

#### Swift

```swift
ACPCore.setPushIdentifier(deviceToken)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Tracking for push and in-app messaging

For more information about setting up tracking postbacks for push and in-app messaging, contact your beta program manager for more detail on creating rules for in-app messaging tracking postback and creating rules for push notifications tracking postback.

For more information, go to [Configuring your application in Launch](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/configuring-app-sdk.html#ConfiguringyourapplicationinLaunch) and search for _Create rules for push notifications tracking postback_ and _Create rules for In-App tracking postback_ .

## Deleting mobile properties in Launch

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting your property in Launch may cause disruption to any recurring push and in-app messaging activities.
{% endhint %}

If you [delete](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/administration/companies-and-properties#delete-a-property) your mobile property in Launch, you might review your mobile property status in Campaign Standard and ensure that the property displays an updated status of **Deleted in Launch**. You may choose to remove the corresponding mobile app in Campaign Standard by clicking the **Remove from ACS** button. For more information, see [Configuring a mobile application using Adobe Experience Platform SDKs](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/configuring-app-sdk.html).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting your mobile property in Launch does not automatically delete your Campaign Standard mobile app.
{% endhint %}

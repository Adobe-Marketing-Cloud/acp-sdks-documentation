# Signal

The Signal extension allows marketers to send a "signal" to their apps through the Experience Platform SDKs. This signal might tell the SDKs or the apps to complete tasks, such as send PII-labeled data, to trigger a postback to a third-party ad-network and open an app deep link or URL. To ensure that signals are sent or are activated, the marketers need to configure triggers and traits in Experience Platform Launch.

The Signal extension is bundled with the [MobileCore \(Android\)/ACPCore \(iOS\)](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/) extension and allows you to send postbacks to third-party endpoints and open URLs, such as web URLs or application deep links, when using rules actions in Experience Platform Launch.

To send PII data to external destinations, the `PII` action can trigger the Rules Engine when certain triggers and traits match. When setting a rule, you can also set the `PII` action for a Signal event. The `collectPii` API can then be used to trigger the rule and send the PII data to a remote server.

To get started with Signal extension, complete the following steps:

1. Add the **Signal** extension to your app.
2. Define the necessary rules in Experience Platform Launch. 
3. \(Optional\) When using Send PII actions in Experience Platform Launch, implement the APIs to collect PII data and send it to the configured third party destination.

For more information about creating and configuring a rule in Experience Platform Launch, see [Rules](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/manage-resources/rules.html).

## Add the Signal extension to your app

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
#### Java

Add the [Mobile Core](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core) extension to your project using the app's Gradle file.

```java
implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:sdk-core:1.+'
```

Import the Signal extension in your application's main activity.

```java
import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.*;
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
â€‹ Add the [Mobile Core](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core) extension to your project using Cocoapods.

Add following pods in your `Podfile`:

```text
pod 'ACPCore'
```

Import the Signal libraries:

#### Objective-C

```text
#import "ACPCore.h"
#import "ACPSignal.h"
```

#### Swift

In Swift, the ACPCore includes ACPSignal:

```swift
import ACPCore
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}
#### JavaScript

Install Signal:

```jsx
npm install @adobe/react-native-acpcore
react-native link @adobe/react-native-acpcore
```

Importing the Signal extension

```jsx
import {ACPSignal} from '@adobe/react-native-acpcore';
```

Note: if using Cocoapods, run:

```text
pod install
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Register the Signal extension

The `registerExtension()` API registers the Signal extension with the Mobile Core extension. This API allows the extension to send and receive events to and from the Mobile SDK.

To register the Identity extension, use the following code sample:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
#### Java

After calling the `setApplication()` method in the `onCreate()` method, register the Signal extension. If the registration was not successful, an `InvalidInitException` is thrown.

```java
public class MobileApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        MobileCore.setApplication(this);
        MobileCore.configureWithAppId("yourAppId");
        try {
            Signal.registerExtension(); //Register Signal extension with Mobile Core
            MobileCore.start(null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Log the exception
         }
    }
}
```

**Important**: The Signal extension is automatically included in Core by Maven. When you manually install the Signal extension, ensure that you add the `signal-1.x.x.aar` library to your project.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
In your app's`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, register the Signal extension with Mobile Core:

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [ACPCore configureWithAppId:@"yourAppId"];
    [ACPSignal registerExtension];
    [ACPCore start:nil];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    return YES;
 }
```

#### Swift

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
     ACPCore.configure(withAppId: "yourAppId")   
     ACPSignal.registerExtension()
     ACPCore.start(nil)
     // Override point for customization after application launch.
     return true;
}
```

**Important**: The Signal extension is automatically included in the Core pod. When you manually install the Signal extension, ensure that you add the `libACPSignal_iOS.a` library to your project.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}
#### JavaScript

```jsx
import {ACPSignal} from '@adobe/react-native-acpcore';

initSDK() {
    ACPSignal.registerExtension();
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Implement the Mobile SDK to send PII data to external destinations

To send PII data to external destinations, the `PII` action can trigger the Rules Engine when the configured triggers and traits match. When creating a rule, you can set the `PII` action for a Signal event, so that `collectPii` can trigger the rule and send the `PII` data.

For more information about `collectPii` and its usage, see [collectPii](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/mobile-core-api-reference#collect-pii).

For more information about how to configure the Signal postbacks in Experience Platform Launch, see [Signal extension and Rules Engine integration](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/resources/user-guides/signal-extension-and-rules-engine-integration).

# Mobile Core

The **Mobile Core** represents the core Adobe Experience Platform SDK required for any app implementation. The core contains common set of functionality and frameworks such as a Experience Cloud Identity services, data event hub, rules engine, reusable networking, disk access routines, etc., which is required by all Adobe and third-party extensions. Specifically, the core provides the following constituent functionality:

## Configuration methods

For more detail, see [Configuration Methods Reference](configuration-reference/)

## Event hub APIs

The SDK provides core, extension-independent APIs to facilitate event tracking of user screens, actions, and PII data. Events generated by these APIs are published to the SDK event hub and are available for use to individual extensions.  For instance, when the Analytics extension is installed, all user actions and app screens event data will be sent to appropriate Analytics reporting endpoints.

For more detail, see [Mobile Core API Reference](configuration-reference/mobile-core-api-reference.md)

## Rules engine

This Mobile Core contains a rule engine that interprets all tracking, PII, Signals, _Request Content_, and extension-specific events for the SDK. Users may create rules, which when matched, will trigger a _Response Content_ event for the listening extension in order to handle associated consequence\(s\).

For more detail, see [Rules Engine Reference](configuration-reference/rules-engine-reference.md)

## Identity

The Identity framework enables Adobe's Experience Cloud ID service and is a required component for most SDK implementations.

# Lifecycle event reference

## Events Handled by Lifecycle

Here are the events that are handled by the Lifecycle extension:

### Lifecycle Content Request

This event represents a request to the Lifecycle extension to start or pause collecting data and is generated when the `lifecycleStart` and `lifecyclePause` APIs are used.

#### Event Details

| Event Type | Event Source | Paired | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle | com.adobe.eventSource.requestContent | No | N/A |

#### Data Payload Definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| action | String | No | Represents the lifecycle action type and can be one of these values: `start`/`pause` |
| additionalcontextdata | Map | Yes | Map containing the user supplied context data. |

### Data Sample - Start Lifecycle Request <a id="data-sample-start-lifecycle-request"></a>

Here is an example of event data for Lifecycle start request

```text
{    "action": "start",    "additionalcontextdata":{        "key1" : "value1",        "key2" : "value2"    }}
```

### Data Sample - Pause Lifecycle Request <a id="data-sample-pause-lifecycle-request"></a>

```text
{    "action": "pause"}
```

### Hub Shared State

Lifecycle listens for the Configuration Shared State events.

For more details about the Shared State events, see [Events Dispatched by SDK Core - Hub Shared State](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/build-your-own-extension/events/sdk-core/events-dispatched-by-sdk-core#hub-shared-state)​.

## Events Dispatched by Lifecycle

Here are the events that are dispatched by the Lifecycle extension:

### Lifecycle Data Content Response

This event is a response from the Lifecycle module to notify lifecycle context data in which a client/module might be interested. If a callback has been registered, this event can then be used to issue a callback to the user.

It will be generated by the Lifecycle module, when `lifecycleStart` API is called when a new session is started and it contains the lifecycle metrics as part of `lifecyclecontextdata` and previous session information. For more details about available metrics see [Lifecycle Metrics](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/lifecycle/lifecycle-metrics)​

#### Event Details

| Event Type | Event Source | Paired | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle | com.adobe.eventSource.responseContent | No | N/A |

#### Data Payload Definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| lifecyclecontextdata | Map&lt;String,String&gt; | No | The value will be a map of the key-value pairs that are generated by Lifecycle. This data can then be consumed by other modules that want to operate on the data. |
| sessionevent | String | No | The type of event which triggered a `start` response. |
| starttimestampmillis | Long | No | The start timestamp of the new session. |
| maxsessionlength | Long | No | Maximum time in milliseconds before a session is timed out. The value is currently set to 7 days. This key is different from the configuration parameter, `lifecycle.sessionTimeout`, which specifies the timeout for a **paused** session. |
| previoussessionstarttimestampmillis | Long | No | The previous session's start timestamp. If there was no previous session, the value might be `0L` . |
| previoussessionpausetimestampmillis | Long | No | The previous session's pause timestamp. If there was no previous session, the value might be `0L` . |

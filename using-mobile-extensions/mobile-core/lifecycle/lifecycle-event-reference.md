# Lifecycle event reference

## Events handled by Lifecycle

The following events are handled by the Lifecycle extension:

### Lifecycle content request

This event represents a request to the Lifecycle extension to start or pause collecting data and is generated when the `lifecycleStart` and `lifecyclePause` APIs are used.

#### Event details

| Event Type | Event Source | Paired | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle | com.adobe.eventSource.requestContent | No | N/A |

#### Data payload definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `action` | String | No | Represents the lifecycle action type and can be one of these values: `start`/`pause` |
| `additionalcontextdata` | Map | Yes | Map that contains the user-supplied context data. |

### Data sample - Start Lifecycle request <a id="data-sample-start-lifecycle-request"></a>

Here is an example of the event data for Lifecycle start request:

```text
{    "action": "start",    "additionalcontextdata":{        "key1" : "value1",        "key2" : "value2"    }}
```

### Data sample - Pause Lifecycle Request <a id="data-sample-pause-lifecycle-request"></a>

```text
{    "action": "pause"}
```

### Hub shared state

Lifecycle listens for the Configuration shared state events.

For more information about the shared state events, see [Events Dispatched by SDK Core - Hub Shared State](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/build-your-own-extension/events/sdk-core/events-dispatched-by-sdk-core#hub-shared-state)​.

## Events dispatched by Lifecycle

The following events are dispatched by the Lifecycle extension:

### Lifecycle data content response

This event is a response from the Lifecycle module to notify lifecycle context data in which a client/module might be interested. If a callback has been registered, this event can be used to issue a callback to the user.

The event is generated by the Lifecycle extension, when the `lifecycleStart` API is called when a new session is started and it contains the lifecycle metrics as part of `lifecyclecontextdata` and previous session information. For more information about the available metrics, see [Lifecycle Metrics](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/lifecycle/lifecycle-metrics)​.

#### Event details

| Event Type | Event Source | Paired | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `com.adobe.eventType.lifecycle` | `com.adobe.eventSource.responseContent` | No | N/A |

#### Data payload definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Optional** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lifecyclecontextdata` | Map&lt;String,String&gt; | No | The value is a map of the key-value pairs that are generated by Lifecycle. This data can be consumed by other modules that want to operate on the data. |
| `sessionevent` | String | No | The type of event which triggered a `start` response. |
| `starttimestampmillis` | Long | No | The start timestamp of the new session. |
| `maxsessionlength` | Long | No | Maximum time in milliseconds before a session times out. The value is currently set to 7 days. This key is different from the configuration parameter, `lifecycle.sessionTimeout`, which specifies the timeout for a **paused** session. |
| `previoussessionstarttimestampmillis` | Long | No | The previous session's start timestamp. If there was no previous session, the value might be `0L` . |
| `previoussessionpausetimestampmillis` | Long | No | The previous session's pause timestamp. If there was no previous session, the value might be `0L` . |
